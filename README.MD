# ⚖️ AI based Multi-Criteria Decision Making with Dempster-Shafer Theory

This repository empowers you to tackle complex decisions with the power of Artificial Intelligence and Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory.

***What's the magic?***

**Multi-Criteria Analysis:** Evaluate decisions based on multiple, often conflicting, criteria.<br>
**Dempster-Shafer Theory:** A powerful framework for handling uncertainty and imprecise information in decision making.
**AI-powered Automation:** Leverage the ds_ahp.ipynb script, a treasure trove of functions, to automate calculations and analysis.

***Why choose this?***

**Data-Driven Decisions:** Make informed choices based on your data, stored conveniently in Docs and Excel files within the input folder.
**Uncertainty Management:** Handle ambiguity and incomplete information inherent in real-world decisions using DS theory.
**Streamlined Workflow:** The provided Jupyter notebook guides you through the analysis process, delivering the final results in the Final results file.


***Target***

Decision-makers facing complex scenarios with multiple criteria.
Data analysts seeking to integrate DS theory into their workflows.
Anyone interested in leveraging AI for more robust decision making.

## Getting Started

***Clone the repository:***

Bash
```
git clone https://github.com/cycyBell/ai-ds-decision-making.git
```
Use code with caution.

***Prepare your data:***

Place your decision criteria and corresponding data in Docs and Excel files within the input folder. Ensure the data is formatted correctly for the analysis (refer to the notebook for details).

***Run the analysis:***

Open ds_ahp.ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook environment and execute the cells. The notebook will guide you through the process and generate the final results.

***Customization is encouraged!***

The provided notebook serves as a foundation. Feel free to:

Modify the functions within ds_ahp.ipynb to tailor the analysis to your specific needs.
Experiment with different data formats within the input folder.
Extend the script to incorporate additional criteria or decision-making frameworks.
Reach for the Skies
This repository provides a launchpad for exploring the exciting intersection of AI and multi-criteria decision making. Take it further by:

Visualizing the results using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.
Integrating the analysis pipeline into a web application for wider accessibility.
Exploring more advanced decision-making frameworks alongside DS theory.
Let's make informed decisions together, even in the face of uncertainty!
